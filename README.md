# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

Changes to Kaia's repo needed for Expo SDK52 (cli 0.22.20)

This repo is still in its early stage, tested only on the iOS simulator. 

No changes to the canisters stuff, I use the ones provided by Kaia

Basically:
- updated package versions
- the content of App.js now is src/app/index.tsx
- the URL of the deep link contains the string *redirect*, so a redirect.tsx is needed under src/app
- deep link URL is taken from the environment (EXPO_PUBLIC_DEEP_LINK)
- I used Expo Go, so the deep link url has a *exp:* scheme: exp://127.0.0.1:8081/--/

## Get started

1. Install dependencies (both standard expo stuff and the IC libraries), and build the ios and android environment

   ```bash
   npm install
   expo prebuild
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

## Deep Link

After the Authentication phase, control is transfered back to the mobile app, using a **Deep Link**. This kind of link changes from development to production.
