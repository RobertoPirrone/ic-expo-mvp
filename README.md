# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

Changes to Kaia's repo needed for Expo SDK52 (cli 0.22.20)

This repo is still in its early stage, tested only on the iOS simulator. 

No changes to the canisters stuff, I use the ones provided by Kaia

Basically:
- updated package versions
- the content of App.js now is src/app/index.tsx
- the URL of the deep link contains the string *redirect*, so a redirect.tsx is needed under src/app
- deep link URL is taken from the environment (EXPO_PUBLIC_DEEP_LINK)
- I used Expo Go, so the deep link url has a *exp:* scheme: exp://127.0.0.1:8081/--/

## Get started

1. Install dependencies (both standard expo stuff and the IC libraries), and build the ios and android environment

   ```bash
   npm install
   expo prebuild
   ```

2. Start the app in Expo Go

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

    type "i" for the iOS emulator, or "a" for Android (or point the QR code from a real device)
    
    On the iOS Simulator the fingerprint is under *Features/TouchId*, you may need to deselect and select again the *Enrolled* entry, then you can use the *Matching Touch* entry

3. Production builds

    Follow the usual steps (either EAS or XCode/ bundletool) for building and publishing of a Release package

    Local Build in production mode (w/o signing):

   ```bash
    expo run:android --variant release # https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/#compiling-android
    expo run:ios --configuration Release # https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/#compiling-ios
   ```

    Example for EAS:

   ```bash
    eas login
    eas init
    eas build:configure
    eas build # Answer All for both platforms)
    eas submit --platform ios 


   ```


## Deep Link

After the Authentication phase, control is transfered back to the mobile app, using a **Deep Link**. This kind of link changes from development to production.
